# Linear-Regression-using-Scikit-Learn
This Jupyter Notebook uses Scikit-Learn to show off the power of linear regression. It ensures a practical learning experience by guiding you through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. This notebook gives you the fundamentals of linear regression in Python, regardless of your level of experience.

## Features
-  *Data Preprocessing*: Handle missing values, select features, and prepare the dataset for training.
-  *Model Training*: Implement and train a linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
-  *Performance Evaluation*: Assess model accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.
- *Data Visualization*: Generate regression plots, residual plots, and error distributions for better insights.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install the required libraries using:
bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook "Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn.ipynb"
   
3. Execute the cells sequentially to run the complete workflow.
4. Modify parameters or use different datasets to experiment with linear regression techniques.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is *Advertising Budget and Sales.csv*, which contains information on advertising expenditures across multiple media channels and corresponding sales figures.

*Columns in the dataset:*
- *TV*: Advertising budget spent on TV marketing.
- *Radio*: Advertising budget spent on radio marketing.
- *Newspaper*: Advertising budget spent on newspaper marketing.
- *Sales*: Sales figures corresponding to the advertising expenditure.

Ensure the dataset is present in the working directory before running the notebook.

##  Model Evaluation Metrics
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted sales.
- *R-squared (R²) Score*: Evaluates how well advertising expenditures explain the variance in sales.
